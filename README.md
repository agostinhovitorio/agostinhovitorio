- I have a postgraduate degree in systems analysis and development. I already finished my degree in September 2022.
I have two groups of knowledge: I have training in humans and now in exacts. I like technology, especially about the future of computing, I like reading, I’m a bodybuilder and I’m a musician too.

I am currently learning to program and analyze within the object orientation paradigm. Especially Javascript languages on their Nodejs and Reactjs programming platforms. I’m also learning the . NET language for C#, Java language as well.

I am looking to collaborate on any project that I can learn new things, especially on the back and front end.
